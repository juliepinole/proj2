# [WIP. ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE ETH CLASS OF ML IN HEALTHCARE!!!]

This repository is still WIP and does not comply with Python style guidelines. It has been made public to favorize collaboration within the ML in Healthcare class of the ETH.


# Project 2: Time Series and Representation Learning

## Notebooks by questions

###  Heart Disease

*  **Q1, Q2**: [Heart_explo_and Logistic](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/heart/Heart_explo_and%20Logistic.ipynb)
*  **Q3**: [Heart_MLP](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/heart/Heart_MLP.ipynb)
*  **Q4**: [Heart_explo_NAM](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/heart/Heart_explo_NAM.ipynb)
###  Chest Xrays
*  **Q1, Q2**: [Chest_explo_and_cnn](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/chest/Chest_explo_and_cnn.ipynb)
*  **Q3, Q4**: [Chest_interpretability](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/chest/Chest_interpretability.ipynb)

## Virtual Environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The result of `pip list` in the virtual environment that I used in in the file [venv.txt](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/venv.txt).

> [!NOTE]
> I made some changes to some [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package core code that I did not manage to revert. I thus created a second virtual environment to reinstall [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and to run the SHAP section of the [Heart_MLP](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/heart/Heart_MLP.ipynb) notebook. `pip list` outcome in the file [venv_2.txt](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/venv_2.txt) However I doubt there is any difference with the main environment [venv.txt](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/venv.txt) which is what I used everywhere (except that [venv_2.txt](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/venv_2.txt) is a strict subset of [venv.txt](https://github.com/juliepinole/eth/blob/main/healthcare/venv.txt). I just installed there the few packages needed to run the section of interest. I thus think it can be ignored.

## Data import in notebooks

* **Heart Disease**: there is no action required, the relevant csv files are in the same folder as the notebookds and are imported through pd.read_csv().
> [!IMPORTANT]
> * **Chest Xrays**: [ACTION REQUIRED]. The path to the data have to be filled as the first argument of the function lib.get_training_data() as in orange in the image below:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data folders need to have the same structure as in the initial dataset. From the path filled above, two folders need to be present:
>
> *  PNEUMONIA: with the examples of xrays from patients suffering from pneumonia.
> *  NORMAL: with the examples of xrays from healthy patients.


## Parameters

Each notebook has a cell declaring a class of parameters (see image below), which are then potentially called and changed across the notebook.

I have set the default value of the parameters to the value that I used eventually, so in principle no change of parameter is needed at all, but if need be, parameters changes can be performed easily. See example:
