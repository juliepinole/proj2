# [WIP. ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE ETH CLASS OF ML IN HEALTHCARE!!!]

This repository is still WIP and does not comply with Python style guidelines. It has been made public to favorize collaboration within the ML in Healthcare class of the ETH.


# Project 2: Time Series and Representation Learning

## Notebooks by questions

###  Part 1: Supervised Learning on Time Series

*  **Q1**: [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q1_Exploration.ipynb)
*  **Q2**: [Classic ML Methods](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q2_Classic_ML_Models.ipynb) , [Features Extraction](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q2_features_extraction.ipynb)
> [!NOTE]    
> The features extraction takes some time, this is why they are done separately in the second colab [Features Extraction](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q2_features_extraction.ipynb) (two extractions, one for the train set, the other one for the test set). They are then imported back in the first colab ([Classic ML Methods](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q2_Classic_ML_Models.ipynb)). These extracted features are uplaoded top github so the path should match and there should not be any action required. See:

*  **Q3**: [LSTM](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q3_LSTM.ipynb)
*  **Q4**: [CNN](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_1_Q4_CNN.ipynb)
*  **Q5**: Unfinished.

###  Part 2: Transfer and Representation Learning
*  **Q1**: [Classic ML Methods + encoder training - MIT BIH Dataset](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_2_Q1_Classic_ML.ipynb)
*  **Q2**: [Representation Learning](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_2_Q2_Representation.ipynb)
*  **Q3**: [Visualization](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_2_Q3_Visualization.ipynb)
*  **Q4**: [Fine_tuning](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/task_1/Part_2_Q4_Fine_Tuning.ipynb)

## Virtual Environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The result of `pip list` in the virtual environment that I used in in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/juliepinole/proj2/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## Data import in notebooks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **[ACTION REQUIRED]**. I did not upload the data to github as I thing that gituhub was complaining about the size. Therefore the paths to the data (in each colab) have to be filled as in orange in the image below:
